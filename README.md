# Image_Identification_Monitoring
This is Git repo of Image Identification based Monitoring Algorithm.

Instead of Capturing all the data which in the Image frame what we'll do is we'll only record the data when ever there is movement in the frame. By doing this we can save a lot of storage space (because we only capturing the frame when there is movement or disturbance in other words) and the navigation will be a lot easier (because we don't have irrelevant information or data).

This project is intelligent enough to classify the person as Authorised or Unauthorised.


Proper Instruction on using this project will be updated soon. (as of 31-05-2021).
